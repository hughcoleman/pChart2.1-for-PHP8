pChart 2.1 library for PHP 8
============================

This is based on `pChart 2.0 for PHP7` at https://github.com/bozhinov/pChart2.0-for-PHP7/tree/7.x-compatible .

The goal is simple. Keep the old 2.0 compatible version alive, and make it more PHP8 compatible.

Since the latest compatible version was `2.1.4.b` and not a `2.0` the repository was renamed.
